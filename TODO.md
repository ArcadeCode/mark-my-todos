## üßπ Project Cleanup & Enhancements

- [ ] Add badges from [shields.io](https://shields.io) to README for build status, coverage, etc.
- [ ] Automate testing workflow with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Refactor `Todo.ts` by decomposing it into a dedicated `./todo/` directory, splitting logic into files like `sanitize.ts`, `class.ts`, `validate.ts`, etc.
- [ ] Implement path aliases for cleaner imports, e.g., `#shared`, `#services`
- [ ] Optimize logo size and styling (currently too large)
- [ ] Edited logger.xxx to read file name and put it into the log without need of a `context` attribut.
